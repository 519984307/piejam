# PieJam
PieJam is a very, very, very simple audio mixer. It just takes all inputs from
your sound card, mixes them together and outputs the result on first two output channels
of your sound card. The user interface was designed to perfectly fit the 7" Raspberry Pi
touchscreen. The initial idea was to run it as a standalone application on a Raspberry Pi
with an attached USB audio interface. But it can also be executed on any other Linux platform.

See accompanying [PieJam OS](https://github.com/nooploop/piejam_os) repository
on how to create a Linux image for the Raspberry Pi.
